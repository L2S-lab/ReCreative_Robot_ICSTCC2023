# ReCreative_Robot_ICSTCC2023

This repo contains Scratch files to use with DJI RoboMaster S1/EP for pedagogical purposes.

Files are named sccording to the usage.

`Basic_code_Scratch.dsp`: a basic example using the inbuilt gesture recognisation and moving the robot accordingly.

`IFAC_logo.dsp`:  demo of the robot moving in certain pattern and controlling the led lights on the robots to create a light painting. (This might require a large open space.)

`Robot_following_marker.dsp`: used to follow the moving markers that comes with the robot using the robot's inbuilt marker detection tool. Different markers can be used to make a platoon-formation of robots based on the leader follower concept.
